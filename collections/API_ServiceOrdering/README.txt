## TMF API Reference : TMF 641 - Service Ordering Management

 Version 4.0 

The Service Order API provides a standardized mechanism for managing Service Order, a type of order which can be used to place an order between internal Customer Order management system to service order management system or between a service provider and a partner and vice versa.

### Service Order resource
A service order will describe a list of service order items.  A service order item references an action on an existing  or  future  service.  By  service  we  designed  Customer Facing  Service  (CFS)  as  well  as  Resource Facing Service (RFS).
From a component perspective, a service order should be available
- from a Service Orchestration Component (and it could mix CFS and RFS)
- from an Infrastructure Control & Management component (and it would have only RFS)
