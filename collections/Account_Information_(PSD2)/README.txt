The Account Information (PSD2) API is used to retrieve account data. You can retrieve transaction information, the current balance of an account or details of the account itself. The API can be used by licensed third party service providers to access ABN AMRO accounts. An account can only be accessed when ABN AMRO's account holder authorizes this through the consent application.
