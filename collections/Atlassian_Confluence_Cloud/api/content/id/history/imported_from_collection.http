// Returns the body of a macro in storage format, for the given macro ID.
// This includes information like the name of the macro, the body of the macro,
// and any macro parameters. This method is mainly used by Cloud apps.
// 
// About the macro ID: When a macro is created in a new version of content,
// Confluence will generate a random ID for it, unless an ID is specified
// (by an app). The macro ID will look similar to this: '50884bd9-0cb8-41d5-98be-f80943c14f96'.
// The ID is then persisted as new versions of content are created, and is
// only modified by Confluence if there are conflicting IDs.
// 
// Note, to preserve backwards compatibility this resource will also match on
// the hash of the macro body, even if a macro ID is found. This check will
// eventually become redundant, as macro IDs are generated for pages and
// transparently propagate out to all instances.
// 
// **[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/_AozKw) required**:
// Permission to view the content that the macro is in.
