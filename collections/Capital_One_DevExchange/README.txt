Nessie is Capital One???s Hackathon API that gives you access to a multitude of real public-facing data - such as ATM and bank branch locations - along with mock customer account data. Use HTTP requests to set up peer-to-peer transactions, simulate a weekly paycheck, or even schedule bills for customers! This is all structured in a way that resembles how we actually run things here at Capital One.
