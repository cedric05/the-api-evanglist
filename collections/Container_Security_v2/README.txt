Container Security API provides the endpoints for securing container images, for example, Docker. Using the API, you can you seamlessly and securely enable DevOps processes by providing visibility into the security of container images – including vulnerabilities, malware and policy violations – through integration with the build process.

For background information about managing container security, see the [documentation site](https://docs.tenable.com/tenableio/containersecurity/Content/ContainerSecurity/Welcome.htm).
