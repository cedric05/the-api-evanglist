The Content Delivery API (CDA), available at [cdn.contentstack.com](https://cdn.contentstack.com), is a read-only API used to retrieve content from your Contentstack account and deliver it to your web or mobile properties.

The Contentstack CDA Postman Collection is a set of preconfigured REST API requests that will make it easy for you to get started with the [Contentstack Delivery APIs](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/apis/content-delivery-api/) and try out our API requests through the [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) REST client.
