The Content Management API (CMA) Requests can be used to manage the content of your Contentstack account. The CMA Requests help you create, update, delete, and fetch content of your account.

The Contentstack CMA Postman Collection is a set of preconfigured REST API requests that will make it easy for you to get started with the [Contentstack Management APIs](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/apis/content-management-api/) and try out our API requests through the [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) REST client.
