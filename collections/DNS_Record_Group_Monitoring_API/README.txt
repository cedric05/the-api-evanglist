A DNS record group is a logical collection of DNS records. DNS record groups can have a one-to-one correlation with zone files, but other types of groupings are possible as well, such as grouping by service or customer. See the DNS record groups page for more details. The DNS Check API is used to request data for either a specific record group, or all DNS record groups owned by your account.
