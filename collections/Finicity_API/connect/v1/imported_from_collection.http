// No matter how you plan on implementing Finicity Connect, you’ll need to generate and retrieve a Finicity Connect Link.  You will need to specify what type of Finicity Connect you need depending on what will happen once the customer accounts and transaction data are gathered.  Below you’ll find how to generate the Connect link as well as where to specify what type of Finicity Connect you need.
// 
// Once you have generated the link it will only last until the authentication token under which it was generated expires.  After that you will need to regenerate the Connect link under a new authentication token. We recommend generating a new authentication token when you generate a Connect link, to guarantee a full two hour life-span.
// 
// Several Finicity products utilize Finicity Connect, and most products have their own type of Connect.  The Connect type is controlled by the “type” code in the call.  Many times the type also corresponds to the report that will be run upon completing the Connect flow.
// 
// It is best to use the documentation for the specific use case you are interested in as the documentation here is a list of all the possible parameters you can send for this endpoint depending on the use case. See the following more specific documentation for your use case.......
