// No matter how you plan on implementing Finicity Connect, you’ll need to generate and retrieve a Finicity Connect Link.  Connect provides you with a complete user experience, which requires minimal work in integration.  
// Once you have generated the link it will only last until the authentication token under which it was generated expires. After that you will need to regenerate the Connect link under a new authentication token. We recommend generating a new authentication token when you generate a Connect link, to guarantee a full two hour life-span.
// Connect features:
// * Sign in, the user’s credentials and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
// * Search for the user’s financial institutions
// * Manage the user’s accounts
// 
// 
// **MVS Developers**
// 
// Use the `experience` parameter to call (per session) the Connect and the MVS application modules in the body of the request.
//  
// You can prepopulate the consumer’s SSN (only the last 4 digits appear) and DOB to display on the Find employment records page at the beginning of the MVS payroll module. Pass the SSN and DOB values for the consumer in the body of the request call.
