The Ge.tt API allows you to use Ge.tt in your own applications. We believe that our users should be able to access their files and share their content in their platform of choice. By using the API, developers are able to easily put their own content, or the content of their users online. At the same time they are able to use Ge.tt's unique real-time file sharing technology where files are available before they are even uploaded.
