This is a collection that will publish a CSV as a Postman collection, allowing you to use Postman mock servers as essentially a static data API deployment solution. To run, you will need the "Process CSV" environment from this workspace. Next I will create one that just adds to an existing collection, then I will autogenerate the mock and add the URL to an environment. If there are any characteristics you'd like to see, feel free to fork and add, or leave a comment on the collection.
