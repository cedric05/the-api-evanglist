GraphQL Content Delivery API is an efficient alternative to the Content Delivery APIs. It lets you fetch customized responses or retrieve data of nested or multiple resources through a single API request.

The Contentstack GraphQL Postman Collection is a set of preconfigured  GraphQL API requests that will make it easy for you to get started with the [GraphQL Content Delivery API](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/apis#graphql-content-delivery-api) and try out our API requests through the [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) REST client.
