This Postman Collection refers to the [Kong Community Edition Admin API](https://docs.konghq.com/2.0.x/admin-api/) for running Kong configured with a database (Postgres or Cassandra). For using the Admin API for Kong in DB-less mode, please refer to the Admin API for DB-less Mode [konghq](https://docs.konghq.com/2.0.x/db-less-admin-api/).<br>

**Disclaimer**: Collection not hardened by development AToW [George Jeffcock](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgejeffcock/)

Kong comes with an internal RESTful Admin API for administration purposes. Requests to the Admin API can be sent to any node in the cluster, and Kong will keep the configuration consistent across all nodes.

* **8001** is the default port on which the Admin API listens.
* **8444** is the default port for HTTPS traffic
