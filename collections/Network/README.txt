I needed a list of all the workspaces in the [Postman API Network](https://www.postman.com/explore) to be able to understand who was adding their workspaces, but also to act as a "diff" for other work I am doing. Without an official workspaces API that will pull all workspaces from the network I resorted to a ScrAPI. I will update this weekly if I have time, but hopefully we end up with an approach I can fully automate until we have an API.
