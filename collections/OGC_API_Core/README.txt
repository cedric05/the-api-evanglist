This is a sample OpenAPI definition that conforms to the conformance
classes "Core", "GeoJSON", "HTML" and "OpenAPI 3.0" of the draft
standard "OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core".

This example is a generic OGC API Features definition that uses path
parameters to describe all feature collections and all features.
The generic OpenAPI definition does not provide any details on the
collections or the feature content. This information is only available
from accessing the feature collection resources.

There is [another example](ogcapi-features-1-example2.yaml)
that specifies each collection explicitly.
