This runs a report for all of the governance tests executed and stored as part of the environment, providing a single report of what happens across many governance tests. This type of governance testing uses the same underlying Postman features for testing each API implementation, but for governance we are testing the OpenAPI. **This doesn't work since I broke up the governance into separate collections. I will update to accommodate to work with new model ASAP**
