This is a collection for governing the version applied to any OpenAPI. Use the configure folder to load the OpenAPI into the governance environment, then you can run any individual request manually, as runner, or in pipeline using Newman. This type of governance testing uses the same underlying Postman features for testing each API implementation, but for governance we are testing the OpenAPI.
