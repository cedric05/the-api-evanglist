With funding from the U.S. Department of Energy, SunSpec Alliance joined with Smart Electric Power Alliance, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, kWh Analytics, Solar Energy Industries Association, and more than 500 industry practitioners to simplify the exchange of solar project data using [the Orange Button data standard](https://orangebutton.io/).

This is a project to move forward the OpenAPI for Orange Button, add in the path detail for the surface area of the API. The paths are defined as part of [documentation](https://sunspec.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/OrangeButtonAPISpecification-Final.pdf), but aren't reflected in the OpenAPI provided by Orange Button. The goal in this workspace is to get the OpenAPI to a point where it can be mocked to demonstrate how it works, and then setup testing for the energy API specification.

This is not an official Orang eButton APIs workspace, but feel free to fork and comment on any of the APIs or collections you find in this workspace .If you have any questions feel free to leave a comment or email info@apievangelist.com, or if you are from Orange Button feel free to create your own workspace, and we'll begin forking your collections rather than offering our own.
