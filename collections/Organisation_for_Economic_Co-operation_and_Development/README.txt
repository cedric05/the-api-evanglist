The OECD has application programming interfaces (APIs) that provide access to datasets in the catalogue of OECD databases. The APIs allow you to query the data in several ways, using parameters to specify your request so that you can create innovative software applications which use OECD datasets. The APIs are available in JSON and XML formats. You can read more about the technical specifications of the data interfaces for JSON format in the API Documentation (JSON) and in API documentation (SDMX-ML).
