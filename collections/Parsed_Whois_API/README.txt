The DomainTools API is organized into distinct products with queries that follow a RESTful URL structure wherever possible. Each product offers free, un-authenticated access for the sample URLs listed with each product. If you haven't already, you may want to review the getting started document to learn about authentication and response formats. The Parsed Whois API provides parsed information extracted from the raw Whois record. The API is optimized to quickly retrieve the Whois record, group important data together and return a well-structured format. The Parsed Whois API is ideal for anyone wishing to search for, index, or cross-reference data from one or multiple Whois records.
