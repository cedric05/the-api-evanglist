// Only authenticated organization owners can add a member to the organization or update the member's role.

// *   If the authenticated user is _adding_ a member to the organization, the invited user will receive an email inviting them to the organization. The user's [membership status](https://developer.github.com/v3/orgs/members/#get-organization-membership-for-a-user) will be `pending` until they accept the invitation.
//     
// *   Authenticated users can _update_ a user's membership by passing the `role` parameter. If the authenticated user changes a member's role to `admin`, the affected user will receive an email notifying them that they've been made an organization owner. If the authenticated user changes an owner's role to `member`, no email will be sent.

// **Rate limits**

// To prevent abuse, the authenticated user is limited to 50 organization invitations per 24 hour period. If the organization is more than one month old or on a paid plan, the limit is 500 invitations per 24 hour period.
