// Checks whether a team has `admin`, `push`, `maintain`, `triage`, or `pull` permission for a repository. Repositories inherited through a parent team will also be checked.
// 
// You can also get information about the specified repository, including what permissions the team grants on it, by passing the following custom [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media/) via the `application/vnd.github.v3.repository+json` accept header.
// 
// If a team doesn't have permission for the repository, you will receive a `404 Not Found` response status.
// 
// **Note:** You can also specify a team by `org_id` and `team_id` using the route `GET /organizations/{org_id}/team/{team_id}/repos/{owner}/{repo}`.

// To add a repository to a team or update the team's permission on a repository, the authenticated user must have admin access to the repository, and must be able to see the team. The repository must be owned by the organization, or a direct fork of a repository owned by the organization. You will get a `422 Unprocessable Entity` status if you attempt to add a repository to a team that is not owned by the organization. Note that, if you choose not to pass any parameters, you'll need to set `Content-Length` to zero when calling out to this endpoint. For more information, see "[HTTP verbs](https://developer.github.com/v3/#http-verbs)."

// **Note:** You can also specify a team by `org_id` and `team_id` using the route `PUT /organizations/{org_id}/team/{team_id}/repos/{owner}/{repo}`.
