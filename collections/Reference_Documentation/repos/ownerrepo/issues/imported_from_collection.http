// List issues in a repository.
// 
// **Note**: GitHub's REST API v3 considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this
// reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by
// the `pull_request` key. Be aware that the `id` of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an _issue id_. To find out the pull
// request id, use the "[List pull requests](https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/#list-pull-requests)" endpoint.
