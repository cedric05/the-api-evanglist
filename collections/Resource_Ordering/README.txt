TMF652: The Resource Order API provides a standard mechanism for creating/placing, updating, canceling and deleting a Resource Order with all necessary order parameters. A Resource Order is based on a resource candidate that is defined in the resource catalog. A Resource candidate makes a Resource Specification available to a resource catalog. Resources can be logical (eg: MSISDN, IP-addresses) or physical (eg: cables, routers, firewalls).
