## Overview 

This collection provides a number of requests to demonstrate the metadata and data that is available for the catalogs and data products that are available through the RDS API.  

## Collection Structure

The collection is organized by RDS catalog; each catalog on the RDS server has a corresponding folder in this collection. Within each catalog, there is a folder for every data product in that catalog. These data product folders will contain example requests to query for metadata, record-level data, and aggregate-level data. 

### Visualizations

Each request also has an associated visualization component that presents the returned data in a stylized format. To use this feature, import this collection into your workspace by clicking the orange "Run in Postman" button in the top right corner of the screen. You will then need to send the request, and toggle over to the "Visualizer" tab in the response pane.

## Creator

The [Rich Data Services (RDS)](https://www.richdataservices.com) API was written by [Metadata Technology North America (MTNA)](https://mtna.us?utm_source=postman&utm_medium=postmanlabs) and is designed to provide data and metadata together in a unified API. MTNA is a business located in Knoxville, TN that provides high-level expertise around the technical management of statistical and scientific data. MTNA has worked with statistical agencies around the globe, creating solutions around comprehensive metadata management, data collection and ingestion, and data dissemination.
