Sphereon Storage API provides an abstraction layer for storage of (virtual) folders and streams (files/contents) fully agnostic with respect to supported storage backends. This allows for easy uniform access to and manipulation of contents regardless of the content backend being used. Currently the following backends are supported: Sphereon Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage or one of the Xillio supported content repositories like Documentum, Dropbox etc.
