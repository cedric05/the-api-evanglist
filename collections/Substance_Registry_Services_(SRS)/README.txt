The Substance Registry Services (SRS) is the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) central registry for information about regulated and monitored substances. The SRS provides a common basis for identification of chemicals, biological organisms, and other substances listed in environmental statutes and EPA data systems, as well as substances of interest from other sources, such as other Federal agencies or international organizations. States also may store their substance lists within the SRS. The SRS supports and conforms to EPA’s Chemical Identification Data Standard and the EPA’s Biological Identification Data Standard and is a component of the centralized System of Registries (SoR), which provides access to the Agency’s core registry systems. </br></br>The SRS REST Services allows the use of web services to access data from the SRS. Single substance queries pull standardized information about a substance as well as the environmental statutes and data systems that track or regulate that substance and the synonym(s) used by those lists for the substance.
