// The `/liabilities/get` endpoint returns various details about an Item with loan or credit accounts. Liabilities is supported for US and Canada accounts only. Currently supported account types are account type `credit` with account subtype `credit card` or `paypal`, and account type `loan` with account subtype `student` or `mortgage`. To limit accounts listed in Link to types and subtypes supported by Liabilities, you can use the `account_filter` parameter when [creating a Link token](/docs/api/tokens/#linktokencreate).
// 
// The types of information returned by Liabilities can include balances and due dates, loan terms, and account details such as original loan amount and guarantor. Data is refreshed approximately once per day; the latest data can be retrieved by calling `/liabilities/get`.
// 
// Note: This request may take some time to complete if `liabilities` was not specified as an initial product when creating the Item. This is because Plaid must communicate directly with the institution to retrieve the additional data.

// `/employers/search` allows you the ability to search Plaidâ€™s database of known employers, for use with Deposit Switch. You can use this endpoint to look up a user's employer in order to confirm that they are supported. Users with non-supported employers can then be routed out of the Deposit Switch flow.
// 
// The data in the employer database is currently limited. As the Verification of Income product progresses through the beta period, more employers are being regularly added. Because the employer database is frequently updated, we recommend that you do not cache or store data from this endpoint for more than a day.
