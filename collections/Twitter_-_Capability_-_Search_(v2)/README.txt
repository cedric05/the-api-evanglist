##Overview
This is a Postman collection for quickly getting up and running with just making Twitter searches for the U.S. 2020 Election via the TWitter V2 Recent Search APIs. To use, [you will need to setup an application in your own Twitter account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps), and add the keys or bearer token to the environment for this collection.

This is a pretty straightforward search using the Twitter V2 Recent Search API, but uses a test script that processes the response and aggregates the annotation entities and domains returned and renders them using Postman visualizer.

If you have any questions, comments, or feedback on this election you can email info@apievangelist.com, or tweet at @apievangelist.
