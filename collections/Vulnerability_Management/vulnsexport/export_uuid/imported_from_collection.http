// Returns the status of a vulnerability export request. Tenable.io processes the chunks in parallel, so the chunks may not complete in order.

// Downloads exported vulnerabilities chunk by ID as a JSON file. The response content type is `application/octet-stream`.
// 
// Chunks are available for download for up to 24 hours after they have been created. Tenable.io returns a 404 message for expired chunks. Tenable.io processes the chunks in parallel, so chunk IDs may not be arranged sequentially in the completed output. Export chunks do not include an attribute if that attribute is empty in the vulnerability record.
// 
// A successful response message contains attributes that correspond to CVSS metrics; these metrics are described fully in the following documents:<ul><li>[A Complete Guide to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System, Version 2.0](https://www.first.org/cvss/v2/guide)</li><li>[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.0: Specification Document](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document)</li></ul><p>Requires ADMINISTRATOR [64] user permissions.

// Cancels the specified export job. If you cancel an export job, Tenable.io finishes any chunk that is currently processing, terminates the processing of any unprocessed chunks, and updates the job status to `CANCELLED`. If a cancelled job includes completed chunks, you can download those chunks for three days after cancellation. <p>Requires ADMINISTRATOR [64] user permissions.
