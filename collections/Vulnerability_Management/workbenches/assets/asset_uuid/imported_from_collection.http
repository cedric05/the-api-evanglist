// Deletes the specified asset. When you delete an asset, Tenable.io deletes vulnerability data associated with the asset. Deleting an asset does not immediately subtract the asset from your licensed assets count. Deleted assets continue to be included in the count until they automatically age out as inactive.
// 
//  **Note:** This endpoint is not intended for large or frequent exports of vulnerability or assets data. If you experience errors, reduce the volume, [rate](doc:rate-limiting), or [concurrency](doc:concurrency-limiting) of your requests or narrow your filters. Contact support if you continue to experience errors. Additionally, Tenable recommends the [POST /vulns/export](ref:exports-vulns-request-export) endpoint for large or frequent exports of vulnerability data, and the [POST /assets/export](ref:exports-assets-request-export) endpoint for large or frequent exports of assets data.
