// Returns the status of a pending export. When an export has been requested, it is necessary to poll this endpoint until a "ready" status is returned, at which point the file is complete and can be downloaded using the [export download](ref:workbenches-export-download) endpoint.

If you experience errors, reduce the volume, [rate](doc:rate-limiting), or [concurrency](doc:concurrency-limiting) of your requests or narrow your filters.
