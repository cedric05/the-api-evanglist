Full life cycle application programming interface (API) management is about the planning, design, implementation, testing, publication, operation, consumption, maintenance, versioning and retirement of APIs. It involves use of a developers' portal to target, market to and govern communities of developers who embed the APIs, as well as runtime management, estimation of API value and analytics. It is impossible to provide the platform for any digital strategy, build ecosystems and run an effective API program, without full life cycle API management.
