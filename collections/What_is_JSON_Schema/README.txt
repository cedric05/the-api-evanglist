Allowing you to describe your existing data formats, which provides a human and machine readable definition that allows for validation as part of automated testing, the submission of client data, and many other purposes. JSON Schema vocabularies are used as part of OpenAPI and AsyncAPI, relying on this specification to describe the request, response, and message payload of different types of APIs.
