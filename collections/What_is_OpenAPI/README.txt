OpenAPI is a machine (and human) readable specification for describing the surface area of an HTTP application programming interface, or simply API. OpenAPI is used to describe the details of making a request to an API, as well as what you will receive as a response. Which is often used to generate documentation for APIs, but then can also be used for mocking, testing, security, and other considerations when producing or consuming an API.
