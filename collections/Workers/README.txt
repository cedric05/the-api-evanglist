The Workers APIs support the management of workers in an organization. A worker is a person who performs duties and responsibilities for an organization. In that capacity, a worker fills one or more positions via a work assignment. For a given work assignment, a worker is related to the organization as an employee or contractor. The Workers APIs can be used to obtain a list of all workers in an organization and to get information about work assignments.
